To start, just open a terminal and run the following command in this directory:

    python -m CGIHTTPServer 8000

and then navigate to http://localhost:8000 in your web browser.

Tested on:
 * Mac OS 10.8 (Mountain Lion) with Apple's Python 2.7.2 and MacPorts' Python 2.7.5
 * Windows 8 with Python 2.7.5 (x86-64) download from http://python.org/.

 Note for Windows users
 ----------------------

Windows, unlike Mac OS, does not come with Python. Windows users should go to
http://python.org/download/ and obtain the latest Windows installer for Python
2.7. After runing the installer, open a terminal and navigate to this diretory.
Then, run the following command:

    C:\Python27\python -m CGIHTTPServer 8000

Then, as usual, open a web browser and navigate to http://localhost:8000.
