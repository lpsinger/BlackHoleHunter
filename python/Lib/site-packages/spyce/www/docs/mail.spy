Spyce is available free of charge, with full source code. However, like any
open-source project, Spyce is only as active as its community. Here are
some ways to get involved.

<p>
<b>Bug reports</b>
Please submit bug reports to the Spyce <a href=http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?group_id=53655&atid=471121>bug tracker</a>
on SourceForge.
<p>

<b>Mailing Lists</b>
<p>

The Spyce <a href=http://sourceforge.net/mail/?group_id=53655>mailing
lists</a> is the place where users ask questions regarding installation,
configuration and usage. If you know the answer to a question that appeared on
a mailing list, please do not hesistate to send a message to the list in
answer. Alternatively, if you are doing something interesting with Spyce, you
might want to publicize it to other Spyce users: they may find it useful, and
may even be able to assist you. Your help in making the mailing lists a place
where it would be easy to find answers and other useful Spyce-related
information is much appreciated. <p>

The very cute Spyce mascot is called 'Pilpel', which means pepper (as in the
vegetable and the spice) in Hebrew. It's a specially-shaped pepper that
reminds one of a Python snake. Pilpel was designed and drawn by <a
href="http://people.cornell.edu/pages/nk74/">Natalya Katsnelson</a>. <p>


<b>Direct assistance</b>
<p>

If you would like get your hands dirty, there are things for you to do:

<ul>

  <li> report bugs and help in their resolution </li>

  <li> send new code or patches (but please make sure that new code does not
  break things that work) </li>

  <li> write more documentation, more examples and demos </li>

</ul> <p>

If you would like to join the Spyce project as a developer, documenter,
publicist, or in some other capacity, just fire an email. <p>

<b>Spyce evangelism</b>
<p>

Making Spyce more popular means more support from the user community, more bug
reports, more ideas, and more people. All of this can boost Spyce development
and bug fixing activities, improve the quality of support provided by the
community in mailing lists, etc. Here are some evangelism ideas:

<ul>

  <li> place links to the Spyce site at your Web pages </li>

  <li> rate Spyce in software directories such as freshmeat.net and
  OSDir.com </li>

  <li> recommend Spyce in web forums, mailing lists, etc. </li>

  <li> write Spyce reviews for web sites, printed magazines, etc. </li>

  <li> tell your friends </li>

</ul> <p>

Your help in spreading the word and broadening the community is appreciated!
