Alternatively, you can checkout the very latest code from the subversion repository,
by typing the following command: <p>

<table cellpadding=2 align=center border=1>
  <tr><td valign=top align=left nowrap bgcolor=#cccccc><b>
    <font face="arial, helvetica" size="-1">
      svn co http://svn-hosting.com/svn/spyce/trunk/spyce
    </font>
  </b></td></tr>
</table>
<p>
(For windows, <a href=http://tortoisesvn.tigris.org/>Tortoise SVN</a> is usually
the weapon of choice instead of the command line.)
