quote = Black holes are not really black but emit gravitational waves.
weblink = 

[quote2]

quote = Astrophysical black holes are characterized by just two numbers, their mass and spin. This makes them similar to fundamental particles like electrons and protons.
weblink = 

[quote3]

quote = When distorted from their perfect shape black holes emit dying tones whose frequency and damping time depend only on their mass and spin.
weblink = 

[quote4]

quote = Supermassive black holes emit more energy in gravitational waves over the last year before merger than an entire galaxy does in optical radiation throughout its lifetime.weblink = 
weblink = 

[quote5]

quote = Laser Interferometer Space Antenna, the proposed NASA/ESA space based gravitational wave detector, will detect merging supermassive black holes from anywhere in the Universe.
weblink = 

[quote6]

quote = Gamma ray bursts are the most luminous electro-magnetic sources we know, suspected to be the result of the merger of two neutron stars or a neutron star with a black hole.
weblink = 

[quote7]

quote = Gravitational wave detectors are omni-directional: At any given time they are sensitive to more than 40% of the sky.
weblink = 

[quote8]

quote = Gravitational wave detectors observe a wide variety of sources all at the same time: Merging black holes and neutron stars, bursts from supernovae, rapidly rotating neutron stars, cosmic strings, etc.
weblink = 

[quote9]

quote = Our best view ever of the Big Bang will be revealed by gravitational waves because they are travelling to us unscathed from the moment of creation.
weblink = 

[quote10]

quote = Gravitational radiation is responsible for the decrease (of about 10 micro seconds per year) in the orbital period of the Hulse-Taylor binary pulsar.
weblink = 

[quote11]

quote = Under suitable conditions a black hole that results from the merger of two other black holes could be thrown out of a galaxy because of anisotropic gravitational wave emission.
weblink = 

[quote12]

quote = Binary black holes are 'standard-sirens' which means from their observed luminosity we can precisely measure their distance from Earth. This makes them ideal for cosmology.
weblink = 

[quote13]

quote = Binary black holes can one day reveal the secret of Dark Energy - the most challenging problem in cosmology today.
weblink = 

[quote14]

quote = Merging black holes were conceived to be a source of gravitational radiation by Freeman Dyson in 1960 - long before anyone thought of building a gravitational wave detector.
weblink = 

[quote15]

quote = Gravitational radiation, just like radio and other forms of electromagnetic radiation, is composed of just two polarizations only in a more complicated pattern.
weblink = 

[quote16]

quote = A black hole binary emits hundred times more energy in gravity waves in the last second of its life than a star of similar mass emits optical radiation in its entire life (hundreds of millions of years)!
weblink = 

[quote17]

quote = Merging black holes approach each other at close to the speed of light.
weblink =

[quote18]

quote = In the final process of coalescence and merger, black holes lose 5% of their total mass to gravitational radiation. This makes them the most luminous objects in the sky!
weblink = 

[quote19]

quote = The word black hole was coined by John Wheeler in 1967. Although black holes are invisible in the electromagnetic window they are the most luminous objects when seen in the gravitational window.
weblink = 

[quote20]

quote = The centre of the Milky Way contains a six million solar mass black hole. Indeed, astronomers believe that every galaxy hosts a black hole of similar, or up to a thousand times greater, mass.
weblink = 

[quote21]

quote = One of the biggest questions in Cosmology today is how did black holes that reside at galactic cores form. Gravitational-wave observations could provide the clue by directly observing their formation in the early Universe.
weblink = 

[quote22]

quote = British mathematician Roger Penrose has conjectured that singularities - regions of intense gravity - are shrouded in horizons into which we cannot see. Gravitational observations could one day test his conjecture.
weblink = 

[quote23]

quote = Gravitational observations could test if the ultimate fate of all massive stars is really black holes or some other exotic compact star.
weblink = 

[quote24]

quote = White Dwarfs more massive than 1.4 solar masses (the Chandrasekhar limit) collapse to form neutron stars. Gravitational wave observations should tell us the largest mass that a neutron star could have and its internal structure.
weblink = 

[quote25]

quote = If the mass of a neutron star is slowly increased would it collapse to a black hole or some other exotic form of matter? We don't know the answer to this question; gravitational-wave observations could provide the clue. 
weblink =

[quote26]

quote = What is the densest form of matter: neutrons? quarks? strange matter? Gravitational-wave observations could one day reveal.
weblink = 

[quote27]

quote = Are black holes really like fundamental particles characterized by only their mass and spin? LISA should answer by probing the spacetime geometry of a black hole.
weblink = 

[quote28]

quote = Binary black hole signals have been calculated by numerically solving Einstein's equations on supercomputers. These solutions make it possible to search for them using pattern matching techniques.
weblink = 

[quote29]

quote = When a black hole binary merges, the resulting black hole could be imparted with a kick that is so large that it could escape from the host galaxy. 
weblink = 

[quote30]

quote = An interferometric gravitational-wave detector can detect differential changes in its arm lenghts that is a thousand times smaller than the size of an atomic nucleus.
weblink = 

[quote31]
quote = An interferometer detects gravitational waves by measuring the differential displacement (or strain) in its two arms. The strain sensitivity is so good that it is like measuring the difference in the distances to two nearest stars to within the width of human hair.
weblink = 

[quote32]

quote = After decades of effort physicists were successful in 2005 in solving Einstein's equations on a computer. The pretty images of black hole mergers in this game are from those simulations.
